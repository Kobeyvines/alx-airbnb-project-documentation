# üõ†Ô∏è Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Backend Feature Specifications

## üéØ Objective

This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for three core backend features of the Airbnb Clone application:

- User Authentication  
- Property Management  
- Booking System  

Each section includes a description of the feature, its requirements, and performance expectations.

## üîê User Authentication

### Functional Requirements

- Users can register as `guest`, `host`, or `admin`.
- Users can securely log in to the platform.
- The system authenticates users and provides them with access tokens (e.g., JWT).
- Passwords must be stored securely in a hashed format.
- Each email must be unique across all users.

### Input Validation

- Email addresses must be properly formatted and unique.
- Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types).
- Roles must be restricted to predefined values (`guest`, `host`, `admin`).

### Performance Criteria

- Authentication processes (e.g., login) should respond in under 500ms.
- Token-based authentication should ensure stateless and secure user sessions.
- Password hashing must follow best practices (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

## üèòÔ∏è Property Management

### Functional Requirements

- Hosts can create, update, and delete their property listings.
- Guests can browse available properties.
- Guests can filter listings by location, price, or other criteria.
- Each property is associated with a host (user with a host role).

### Data Requirements

- Each property must include: name, description, location, price per night, and creation date.
- Property ownership must be linked to the correct user account.

### Input Validation

- All required fields must be present and properly formatted.
- Price per night must be a positive value.
- Only hosts can manage property listings.

### Performance Criteria

- Property listings should support efficient searching and filtering.
- Queries should return results in under 800ms.
- Properties should be paginated and optionally searchable by key attributes (e.g., location).

## üìÖ Booking System

### Functional Requirements

- Guests can book a property for specific dates.
- The system calculates the total booking price based on duration and nightly rate.
- Bookings have a status (e.g., `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`).
- Guests can cancel their bookings.
- The system must prevent overlapping bookings for the same property.

### Data Requirements

- Bookings must reference both the user and the property.
- Booking periods must be validated to avoid date conflicts.
- Status tracking for each booking must be included.

### Input Validation

- Dates must be logically correct (`start_date` before `end_date`).
- Property IDs and user IDs must reference valid records.
- Overlapping bookings must be automatically rejected.

### Performance Criteria

- Booking creation, conflict checking, and cancellations must complete in under 600ms.
- The system must be scalable to support multiple concurrent booking operations.
- Bookings must be indexed for fast querying based on dates and property.
