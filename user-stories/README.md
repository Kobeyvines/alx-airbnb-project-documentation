## 💡 Importance of User Stories

User stories are a core component of agile software development. Their importance lies in how they help teams stay aligned with user needs and business goals:

- 🧭 **User-Centered Design**  
  Stories ensure features are built to serve real users rather than assumptions.

- 🛠 **Developer Guidance**  
  They offer clear direction on what to build, why it's needed, and who it benefits.

- 🧪 **Testability**  
  Stories naturally lend themselves to the creation of acceptance criteria and test cases.

- 🔄 **Iterative Development**  
  With stories, teams can continuously deliver small, valuable increments of the product.

- 🤝 **Collaboration**  
  By involving stakeholders early, user stories promote transparency and shared understanding.
